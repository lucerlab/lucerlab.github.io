	<h1>LucerLabs: Photons and data</h1>
	<p>
With more than 12 years of research experience focused on the theoretical and experimental characterization of molecular laser materials, 
my greatest strength is the use of analytical, statistical and numerical methods to extract as much information 
as possible from experimental data sets acquired in our labs or those of our collaborators. With the aim of leveraging my
data analysis skills and expanding my professional horizon towards the Data Science sector, I have recently cursed a Master in Big Data Analytics.

This personal site will centralize all the research and data science doings and achievements of Luis Cerd√°n, PhD</p>

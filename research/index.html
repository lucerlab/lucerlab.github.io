	<h1 style="font-size:40px;">Non-linear dynamics in nanolasers</h1>
	<p> Simulation and study of complex laser dynamics in nanophotonic devices. In
addition to study dynamics in laser devices with novel and exotic photonic properties, I am applying Machine and
Deep Learning algorithms to design nanolasers that can deliver controllable and on demand output signal dynamics
(CW, chaos, ultrashort pulses, ...).

	<h1>Optical Gain Analysis Methodologies</h1>
	<p> Development of tools and protocols to analyze and characterize spectroscopic gain properties in active waveguides and solutions.
My latest achievement in this ground has been the development of a new methodology, implemented
in a Graphical User Interface (ASE Gain Labs), that allows retrieving from a single ASE experiment, the spectrally resolved losses cofficient
and net optical gains at all pump values, as well as to calculate, instead of visually finding, the ASE threshold.

	<h1>Luminescent Boranes</h1>
	<p> Study and characterization of the laser and photophysical properties of novel luminescent
boranes (inorganic boron hydrides). I am in charge of the laser characterization and some of the photophysical studies,
as well as the development of numerical and analytical tools to understand the laser, photophysical, and photochemical
performance of these compounds. The new materials are synthesized by <a href="https://michaellondesborough.com/">Dr. Londesborough</a> (Academy of Science of
the Czech Republic), with whom I maintain a long-standing and fruitful collaboration. 
</p>

	<h1>Nanoparticle based lasers</h1>
	<p> Characterization and simulation of the changes in the photophysical and laser properties uppon incorporation of nanoparticles to dye solutions
 or confinement of the dyes in colloidal polymer nanoparticles. This was one of the topics of my PhD thesis. It is currently mostly inactive.

	<h2>Non-linear dynamics in nanolasers</h2>
	<p> Simulation and study of complex laser dynamics in nanophotonic devices. In
addition to study dynamics in laser devices with novel and exotic photonic properties, I am applying Machine and
Deep Learning algorithms to design nanolasers that can deliver controllable and on demand output signal dynamics
(CW, chaos, pulses, ...).

<h2>Optical Gain Analysis Methodologies</h2>
	<p> Development of tools and protocols to analyze and characterize spectroscopic gain properties in active waveguides and solutions.
My latest achievement in this ground has been the development of a new methodology, implemented
in a Graphical User Interface (ASE Gain Labs), that allows retrieving from a single ASE experiment, the spectrally resolved losses coefficient
and net optical gains at all pump values, as well as to calculate, instead of visually finding, the ASE threshold.

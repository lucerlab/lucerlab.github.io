	<h3>Simulation of non-linear dynamics in nanolasers</h3>
	<p> Recently established research line on the simulation and study of complex laser dynamics in nanophotonic devices. In
addition to study dynamics in laser devices with novel and exotic photonic properties, I am applying Machine and
Deep Learning algorithms to design nanolasers that can deliver controllable and on demand output signal dynamics
(CW, chaos, pulses, ...).

<h3>Optical Gain Analysis Methodologies</h3>
	<p> Research line dealing with the development of tools and protocols to analyze and
characterize spectroscopic gain properties in active waveguides. My latest achievement in this ground has been the development of a new methodology, implemented
in a Graphical User Interface (ASE Gain Labs), that allows retrieving from a single ASE experiment, the spectrally resolved losses coefficient
and net optical gains at all pump values, as well as to calculate, instead of visually finding, the ASE threshold.

	<h1 style="font-size:35px;">Data Science portfolio</h1>
	<p>In this section you will find some of my Data Science projects, either those corresponding to assignments of the Master in Big Data Analytics (UC3M) or 
	those carried out just for the sake of my continuous-learning. Now it is mostly under construction.

<p> Exoplanets are usually categorized according to their mass and their phase state (rocky or gassy planets). In this project, I tried to categorize the
 exoplanets in terms of mass and radius using Gaussian Mixtures Models (GMM) following both frequentist (EM algorithm) and Bayesian (MCMC algorithm) approaches. This 
document comprises the final project for the subject "Bayesian Learning".

	<h1 style="font-size:30px;"><a href= "naive_bayes_text_classifier.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Näive Bayes Clickbait classifier</a></h1>

<p> According to the Oxford Dictionary, Clickbait "describes online content that is designed to encourage the user to click through to a certain web page". 
In this assignment (for the subject "Bayesian Learning"), we had to build a Näive Bayes text classifier capable of discriminating between Clickbait and non-Clickbait headlines.

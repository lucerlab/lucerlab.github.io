	<h1 style="font-size:35px;">Data Science portfolio</h1>
	<p>In this section you will find some of my Data Science projects, either those corresponding to assignments of the Master in Big Data Analytics (UC3M) or 
	those carried out just for the sake of my continuous-learning. Now it is mostly under construction.

	<h1 style="font-size:30px;"><a href= "KMeansBoot_example" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Getting a sense of uncertainties in K-Means with Bootstrap</a></h1>

<p> 
K-Means, can be highly sensitive to the particular realization of the training data. As a result, their predictions inherently carry uncertainty.
A principled and widely used approach to quantify this uncertainty is bootstrap resampling.
This notebook demonstrates the use of <a href="https://github.com/lucerlab/BootKMeans">BootKMeans</a>, a scikit-learn-compatible estimator that integrates bootstrap resampling with K-Means
clustering to provide uncertainty estimates for cluster memberships, centroids, and decision boundaries.

<p> Today's firefighters are "all-hazards" responders. In this project, we carried out a visualization exercise to analyse the emergencies that the Madrid Fire Department has been respoding to over the last years 
in each district putting a strong focus on how these have changed during these last months with the COVID-19 and its consequent lockdown. This 
document comprises the final project for the subject "Networks Analysis and Data Visualization".

<h1 style="font-size:30px;"><a href= "human_activity_recognition.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Human Activity Recognition</a></h1>

<p> The detection and classification of human activity in real time using wearable devices is fundamental for many health monitoring applications. 
In this lab project we had to infer the subject activity (Running, Walking, Standing, Sitting, Lying) using
our classification algorithm of preference. This document comprises an assignment for the subject "Data Analytics for the Smart Society".

	<h1 style="font-size:30px;"><a href= "bayesian_clustering_exoplanets.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bayesian Clustering of Exoplanets</a></h1>

<p> Exoplanets are usually categorized according to their mass and their phase state (rocky or gassy planets). In this project, I tried to categorize the
 exoplanets in terms of mass and radius using Gaussian Mixtures Models (GMM) following both frequentist (EM algorithm) and Bayesian (MCMC algorithm) approaches. This 
document comprises the final project for the subject "Bayesian Learning".

<hr>
	<h1 style="font-size:30px;"><a href= "naive_bayes_text_classifier.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Näive Bayes Clickbait classifier</a></h1>

<p> According to the Oxford Dictionary, Clickbait "describes online content that is designed to encourage the user to click through to a certain web page". 
In this assignment (for the subject "Bayesian Learning"), we had to build a Näive Bayes text classifier capable of discriminating between Clickbait and non-Clickbait headlines.

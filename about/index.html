	<h1 style="font-size:35px;">Luis Cerd√°n, PhD</h1>

<p>

<b>Profile</b>: I hold a PhD in Physics from Universidad Complutense de Madrid and have accumulated almost 15
years of research experience in laser physics and materials. Along these years I have specialized in the use and
 development of analytical, statistical and numerical methods to extract as much information as possible from experimental
 data sets. With the aim of leveraging my data analysis skills and expanding my professional horizon, I have cursed a Master in Big Data Analytics.   </p>

<h1 style="font-size:25px;">Professional and academic track</h1>

	<p> 
In 2006 I completed my studies on Physics at Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM). As part of my degree
curriculum I chose mainly Material Science and Optics related courses. As a follow-up in my university education, I
enrolled in the Master in Fundamental Physics, oriented to Optics, offered by the same University. With the aim of
leveraging and consolidating my data analysis skills and expanding my professional horizon, I have recently cursed the
ocial Master in Big Data Analytics oered by Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. </p>

<p>
I was introduced to the scientic research while performing my rst master degree studies under the supervision of
Prof. R. Weigand, dealing with the theoretical and experimental investigation of the reduction in the group velocity of
light signals by means of coherent population oscillations in saturable absorbers. Afterwards, I joined the Laser Materials 
and Interaction Laser-Materials Group at Instituto de Qu√≠mica F√≠sica "Rocasolano" (IQFR), Consejo Superior de
Investigaciones Cient√≠cas (CSIC), to conduct research on organic lasers under the supervision of Prof. A. Costela and
Prof. I. Garc√≠a-Moreno. During the PhD thesis period, the problem of the optimization and characterization of both
the laser eciency and photostability of solid-state dye lasers was tackled. It is worth highlighting that we demonstrated 
that the use of nanoparticle based systems allowed obtaining record breaking laser eciencies and photostabilities
(Nat. Photonics 6, 621-626 (2012)). This work was featured in Nature Photonics News & Views section, internet, and
in Spanish radio stations and television networks (including an interview for TVE-1 news bulletin). As part of the
doctoral training, I spent three months at the School of Physics and Astronomy, University of St. Andrews University
(UK), to undertake a collaborative research project with Prof. G. A. Turnbull on the fabrication and characterization
of nanostructured organic lasers, and studies of novel dispersive optical eects in organic thin lms. Thanks to my
achievements during this time, I was awarded the "Extraordinary Doctoral Prize 2012-2013" by UCM.</p>

<p>
After the consecution of the PhD degree in 2013, I have been a postdoctoral research assistant and visitor at both
IQFR and the Faculty of Chemistry at UCM. There I have analyzed the performance of dyes with novel and exotic
laser properties. In addition, in 2013 I pioneered and spearheaded the discovery of the rst laser borane (Nat. Comm.
6, 5958 (2015)), a work that was featured in many international media and was chosen as an "Editor's Pick's" on the
prestigious portal photonics.com. As a result of this discovery I opened and led a new research line on the analysis and
characterization of the laser and photophysical properties of luminescent boranes, all in close collaboration with Dr. M.
G. S. Londesborough of the Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, Academy of Science of the Czech Republic. Currently, I am
mostly involved in the development of tools and protocols to analyze and characterize spectroscopic gain properties in
active waveguides. My latest achievement in this ground has been the development of a new methodology, implemented
in a Graphical User Interface (ASE Gain Labs) to ease its use, that allows retrieving from a single experiment what
previously required three of them (Opt. Laser Tech. 121, 105814 (2020)). Finally, I am currently starting to apply
the techniques on Machine and Deep Learning that I have familiarized with in the Master of Big Data Analytics to
conduct research on astrophysical datasets (photometric redshift estimation, exoplanets type classication) or on the
simulation/prediction of complex laser dynamics in nanophotonic devices.</p>

<p>
In parallel, along the later years I have been involved in science spreading activities and have been building up
a role as a scientic advisor, either acting as referee for several journals or serving as consultant to professionals in
dierent elds (arts or education).</p>

<p>
To conclude, all this research and academic training has allowed me to gain ample knowledge and hand-on experience on the use 
of analytical, statistical and numerical methods using programming languages such as Matlab,
Python, and R to extract value from data-sets. I addition, all these years have helped me in developing my networking
and collaborative research skills as well as my independence as a researcher

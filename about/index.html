	<h1 style="font-size:35px;">Luis Cerdán, PhD</h1>

<p>

I am a <b>Ramón y Cajal Fellow</b> at the Instituto de Química Física ``Blas Cabrera'' (IQF-CSIC), with over 15 years of experience at the frontier of Nanophotonics, Laser Physics, and Molecular Materials. My research specializes in the <b>modeling, simulation, and characterization of light-matter interactions</b>, with a specific focus on active materials and devices. I possess a unique interdisciplinary profile that bridges the gap between theoretical frameworks and experimental validation, allowing me to lead complex, cross-functional research lines and interact naturally with both pure theorists and experimentalists.</p>

<p>
My trajectory reflects a strategic evolution <b>from experimental physics to advanced photonic modeling</b>. After completing my <b>PhD at the IQF-CSIC</b> in solid-state dye lasers, I held postdoctoral positions at leading institutions, including the IQF-CSIC, the <b>Institut de Ciència Molecular</b> (Universitat de València), and the <b>Instituto de Óptica</b> (IO-CSIC), conducting interdisciplinary research at the intersection of <b>Laser Physics, Quantum Chemistry, and Nanophotonics</b>. This foundation was complemented by a specialized <b>Master in Big Data Analytics</b>, effectively linking Physics with Machine Learning. This path culminated in the Ramón y Cajal Fellowship, consolidating my <b>leadership within CSIC</b>.</p>
